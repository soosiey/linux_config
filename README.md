# dotfiles

List of dotfiles to work in a Unix environment: gitconfig, bash configs, and vim configs.

The functions.sh file is currently working for what it does: it will link a couple of the config files in the home directory in such a way that they are sourced from wherever the config folder is.
The symlink structure allows editing to happen all in one place so that commits to git can be made, as well as keeping everything nice and clean :).
